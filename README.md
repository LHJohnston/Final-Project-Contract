# Final-Project-Contract
Team contract
## Structure
Each member will be expected to create branches in order to add to the project.

## Procedures 
Members will communicate through Teams. If a branch has conflicts when trying to merge, connect with the Task Manager to review changes before they are pushed. All members should periodically check to make sure their version of the project mirrors everyone else's. Each member should focus on their part, and if any changes need to be made to another members section, contact them before editing or changing anything.

## Expectations of participation
Members are expected to communicate clearly and effectively. Members are also expected to complete their parts of the project in a timely manner. 

## Accountability and Consequences for breech of contract
If a member does not communicate issues that come up and consistently miss deadlines, a strongly worded email or conversation will be had with Dr. Goadrich and the other members shall cast shame upon the guilty party.


## Roles
### Task Manager
I, Leigh Johnston, will be the Task Manager for the team. My responsibilities are to keep an eye on everyone's progress, and communicate any issues to the other members of the team. I will also help divide the responsibilities and keep track of deadlines. I plan to work with everyoneâ€™s schedule and approach conflicts with a calm and empathetic view.
